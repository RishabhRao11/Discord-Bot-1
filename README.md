# Discord-Bot-1 — General-Purpose Discord Bot 

## Overview  
Discord-Bot-1 is a versatile, general-purpose Discord bot written in Python. It provides a variety of functions to automate server tasks and improve Discord server management.  

This bot was developed and delivered as a commercial project — I sold it to a YouTuber for around $40.

## Features & Capabilities  

- **Multipurpose Bot Functions** — The bot can handle utility functions, server automation, and custom commands (depending on how it’s configured).  
- **Persistent Data Storage** — Uses a JSON-based data store (e.g. `mainbank.json`) to track and manage persistent data (for features that require memory across restarts).  
- **Web Interface / Webserver Support** — The `webserver.py` component suggests the bot may include a web-based interface or web-hook support for external integrations.  
- **Easy to Run and Extend** — With minimal setup (Python + dependencies), it’s relatively straightforward to deploy and customize for different Discord servers.

This bot was developed as a paid deliverable.
You’re free to use it for personal projects or self-hosting. If you distribute or deploy it publicly (especially commercially), it would take more attention to the code and dynamics of the bot.
